These files are taken from udunits, version 2.1.17.

The source files have been slightly modified in order to fit them into this
build system. The changes that were made are:

 - scanner.l and parser.y have been renamed to utscanner.l and utparser.y

 - removed 'outfile' %option from utscanner.l

 - scanner.c is no longer included by parser.y resulting in the following
   additional changes:
   - _restartScanner is now a global variable named utrestartScanner
   - #define yyparse utparse
   - #define yylex utlex
   - #define yyerror uterror
   - added ut_get_bufferpos function (returning yy_c_buf_p  - buf->yy_ch_buf)
   - added several function declarations to prevent compiler warnings

 - Added several casts to unsigned to eliminate 'comparison between signed
   and unsigned' warnings.

 - Fixed vector initialisation in ut_decode_time() in unticore.c.

 - Made the following functions static: gregorianDateToJulianDay,
   julianDayToGregorianDate

 - Removed the following static functions since they were not used:
   unitcore.c:timestampNew()
   xml.c:startNoPlural()
   xml.c:endNoPlural()
