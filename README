                HARP 0.4 Release Notes


HARP is a toolset for ingesting, processing and inter-comparing satellite or
model data against correlative data. The toolset is composed of a set of
command line tools and a library of analysis functions. The main goal of HARP
is to assist in the inter-comparison of data sets. By appropriatelty chaining
calls to the HARP command line tools one can preprocess satellite and
correlative data such that the two datasets that need to be compared end up
having the same temporal/spatial grid, same data format/structure, and same
physical unit.

This version of HARP is a beta release to allow the community to get familiar
with the software and provide feedback. HARP still lacks various components
(see below), but these are planned to be added in the near future.
The current version of HARP contains:
 - ingestion of product data for:
   - Sentinel 5P L1/L2
   - Ozone CCI L2/L3/L4
   - NDACC FTIR/Lidar/MWR/UVVIS-DOAS data (GEOMS format)
   - GOME L2
   - GOME-2 L2
   - IASI L1
   - IASI L2
   - OMI L2/L3
   - TES/MLS/HIRDLS L2
   - GOSAT FTS L1/L2
   - GOMOS L1
   - GOMOS L2
   - MIPAS L2
   - SCIAMACHY L2
   - OSIRIS L2
   - SMR L2
   - ECMF GRIB (includes Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS))
   - TEMIS ozone fields
 - import/export of data from/into HARP-specific data format
   The HARP data format standard is a convention on top of netCDF3/HDF4/HDF5
   similar to netCDF-CF (and can be used in conjunction with netCDF-CF).
 - advanced filtering of product data
 - automatic unit conversion of quantities using udunits2
 - automatic generation of quantities ('derived variables') based on
   available product data: you just say which quantity you want, and if HARP
   has an algorithm for it and the necessary inputs quantities are in the
   product, HARP will automatically do all calculations for you
 - built-in AFGL86 and USSTD76 climatology data
 - C Library interface to all core functionality
 - direct ingestion/import/export interfaces for:
   - Python
 - command line tools harpconvert, harpfilter, harpdump, harpcheck
 - harpcollocate command line tool providing collocation of two datasets at
   individual measurement level
 - harpprofile command line tool to modify atmospheric profile data:
   - vertical regridding
   - vertical smoothing using averaging kernels (and a-priori profiles)
 - direct ingestion/import/export interfaces for:
   - MATLAB (Linux + Mac OS X)

Note that HARP is meant as a successor to the BEAT-II interface of the ESA
Atmospheric Toolbox, which means that BEAT-II will at some point become
deprecated and will no longer receive updates.
