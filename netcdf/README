These files are taken from netcdf 4.0.

The source files are taken from the libsrc and include directories and
only contain the code needed to support the classic netcdf3 format.

The source files have been slightly modified in order to fit them into this
build system. The changes that were made are:

 - Added several casts to unsigned to eliminate 'comparison between signed
   and unsigned' warnings.

 - Added '(void)variable;' entries in many functions to eliminate
  'unused parameter' warnings.

 - Added missing initializer values to utf8proc_properties i
   utf8proc_data.h.
