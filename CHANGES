* Added ingestion modules for the following product types:
    - Ozone CCI L3 limb profile products
    - Ozone CCI L2 limb profile products
    - Ozone CCI L4 nadir profile products
    - Ozone CCI L3 nadir profile products
    - Ozone CCI L3 total column products

* Added functions to verify the internal consistency as well as compliance to
  HARP conventions of harp_product and harp_variable instances. Any instance
  of harp_product returned by harp_import() or harp_ingest() has been verified
  using these functions.

* Added derived variable conversion from 'latitude {latitude}' (mid-points) to
  'latitude_bounds {latitude, independent}' (bounds); similar for longitude.

* Changed netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends to be more explicit about implicitly
  created dimensions (which are used to store scalars and strings for formats
  that do not support this natively).

* Fixed handling of scalars and empty strings in netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends.
 
* Fixed unit attribute name in HARP products ('unit' -> 'units').
