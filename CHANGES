* Added Python interface.

* CODA is no longer included as part of HARP, but is treated as a separate
  package, just like HDF4 and HDF5.

* Updated embedded expat library to version 2.1.1.

* Updated embedded udunits2 library to version 2.2.20.

* Fixed parsing of dimension names; string dimension could be interpreted as
  independent dimension.

* Improved the efficiency of the conversion from volume mixing ratio to number
  density and vice versa.

* Update of S5P L2 ingestion module to the lastest version of the product format
  specification (S5P-KNMI-L2-0009-SD and relevant DLR PUMs).

* Update of S5P L1B ingestion module to the lastest version of the product
  format specification (S5P-KNMI-L01B-0012-SD).

* Added ingestion modules for the following product types:
    - Ozone CCI L3 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 limb profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L3 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L4 nadir profile
    - Ozone CCI L2 total column
    - Ozone CCI L3 total column

* Added functions to verify the internal consistency as well as compliance to
  HARP conventions of harp_product and harp_variable instances. Any instance
  of harp_product returned by harp_import() or harp_ingest() has been verified
  using these functions.

* Added derived variable conversion from 'latitude {latitude}' (mid-points) to
  'latitude_bounds {latitude, independent}' (bounds); similar for longitude.

* Changed netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends to be more explicit about implicitly
  created dimensions (which are used to store scalars and strings for formats
  that do not support this natively).

* Fixed handling of scalars and empty strings in netCDF-3/HDF4/HDF5 backends.

* Fixed unit attribute name in HARP products ('unit' -> 'units').

* First beta release (using CODA 2.15).
